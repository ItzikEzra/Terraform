On this branch I add an ansible! </br>
<b>What is Ansible?</b> </br>

Ansible is an open source IT configuration management (CM) and automation platform, </br>
provided by Red Hat. It uses human-readable YAML templates </br>
so that users can program repetitive tasks to occur automatically, without learning an advanced language.</br>

to use in my ansible, </br>

1.  clone it to your machine.</br>
2.  create an host file, enter your machines. </br>
3.  create a varible file and enter the credentials. </br>
4.  run, ansible-playbook playbook.yml. </br>

<H1>Terraform </H1>
in this repo I will present the power of IaC </br>
</br>
<b>What is IaC?</b> </br>
</br>

IaC is infrastructure as code </br>
this is the most elegent way to mange our infrastructure. </br>

<b>WOW man, how we are going to do it??</b> </br>
</br>
We are going to use in an amazing tool- <b>Terraform</b>.</br>

<b>Terraform whatt? never heard about it</b>
</br>

  <p>Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

on this repo I will build a complex topology  </br>
