On this branch I add an ansible! </br>
 <b>What is Ansible?</b> </br>
 
 Ansible is an open source IT configuration management (CM) and automation platform, </br>
 provided by Red Hat. It uses human-readable YAML templates </br>
 so that users can program repetitive tasks to occur automatically, without learning an advanced language.</br>
 
 to use in my ansible, </br>
 1) clone it to your machine.</br>
 2) create an host file, enter your machines. </br>
 3) create a varible file and enter the credentials. </br>
 4) run, ansible-playbook playbook.yml. </br>
